### Branch Additions

This branch enables developers to use a `dateFormat` that isn't 3 characters (e.g. `mdy/`).
You now have the option to display "Month Year" or "Day Month" in all their variations.

*Note: There is a validation error if you select a `dateFormat` that is some variation of only "Day Year"*
